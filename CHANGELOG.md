## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- **TEST-BUG-001**: Fixed race condition in KV mock TTL expiration using snapshot-based timestamp capture (`Date.now() / 1000` at start of operation) to prevent TOCTOU races with mocked time. Added proper expired key cleanup in `list()`
- **TEST-BUG-002**: Fixed memory leak in Fetcher mock call history. Added `maxCallHistory` config with FIFO eviction to prevent unbounded memory growth in long-running test suites
- **TEST-BUG-005**: Fixed Base64URL decode failing on UTF-8 multi-byte characters. Added `base64UrlDecodeBytes()` helper with `TextDecoder`
- **TEST-OPT-003**: Added `maxQueryHistory` config with FIFO eviction to D1 mock, preventing unbounded memory growth (matches pattern from TEST-BUG-002)
